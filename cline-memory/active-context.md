# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have implemented the core components of the 3D calculator and resolved several important rendering issues:
- Scene component with isometric camera setup
- Calculator component with 3D layout
- Interactive 3D buttons with hover and press animations
- Calculator logic using custom hooks
- Fixed client-side component directives for Next.js
- Optimized WebGL context to prevent context loss

## Recent Changes
- Created Scene component with fixed isometric camera view
- Implemented Calculator component with 3D layout and materials
- Created CalculatorButton component with interactive states
- Set up calculator logic with useCalculator hook
- Updated main page to display the calculator
- Added "use client" directives to components using client-side features
- Optimized WebGL context settings to prevent context loss
- Fixed nested Canvas components issue by restructuring component hierarchy
- Added proper component keys for stable rendering

## Current Status
- Basic 3D calculator structure is implemented
- Core calculator functionality is working
- Interactive 3D buttons with visual feedback
- Isometric camera view is fixed and working
- Fixed rendering errors related to Next.js client/server components
- Stabilized WebGL context to prevent context loss on page updates

## Active Decisions
1. **Camera Setup**: Using fixed isometric view with disabled controls for consistent perspective
2. **Button Layout**: Standard calculator layout with 3D buttons
3. **Visual Design**: Modern calculator style with:
   - Light gray body
   - Black display
   - Orange operator buttons
   - Gray function buttons
   - White number buttons
4. **Interaction Model**: 3D buttons with hover and press animations
5. **Next.js Integration**: All Three.js components marked as client components with "use client" directive
6. **WebGL Context**: Optimized settings with preserveDrawingBuffer and high-performance preference

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add shadows and improve lighting
2. Implement button press animations
3. Add sound effects for interactions
4. Improve text rendering in display

### Secondary Tasks
1. Add keyboard support
2. Implement responsive adjustments
3. Add accessibility features
4. Optimize performance

## Open Questions
- Should we add more visual feedback for operations?
- Do we need to implement extended calculator functions?
- Should we add a background or environment to the scene?
