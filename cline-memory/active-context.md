# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are starting the development of a 3D calculator using Three.js with an isometric view. The project is in the initial setup phase.

## Recent Changes
- Created project structure using Next.js 15
- Set up Three.js and React Three Fiber dependencies
- Initialized memory files for the project

## Current Status
- Project initialized with basic Next.js setup
- Core dependencies installed
- Memory documentation created

## Active Decisions
1. **Component Structure**: Planning the hierarchy of React and Three.js components
2. **Calculator Logic**: Determining how to implement calculator functionality
3. **3D Design**: Deciding on the visual style and layout of the 3D calculator
4. **Interaction Model**: Designing how users will interact with 3D buttons

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create a basic 3D scene with isometric camera setup
2. Implement a simple calculator layout in 3D
3. Create interactive 3D buttons
4. Implement calculator logic

### Secondary Tasks
1. Refine visual design and materials
2. Add animations for button presses
3. Implement responsive adjustments
4. Add sound effects for interactions

## Open Questions
- What specific visual style should the calculator have? (modern, retro, futuristic, etc.)
- Should we implement extended calculator functions beyond basic arithmetic?
- Do we need to implement keyboard support for calculator input?
