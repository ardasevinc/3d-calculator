# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have implemented the core components of the 3D calculator and resolved several important rendering issues:
- Scene component with isometric camera setup
- Calculator component with 3D layout
- Interactive 3D buttons with hover and press animations
- Calculator logic using custom hooks
- Fixed client-side component directives for Next.js
- Optimized WebGL context to prevent context loss

However, several visual and interaction issues have emerged:
- Black background instead of expected light background
- Camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate) are currently disabled
- Calculator display text not visible when entering numbers
- Numbers flash when buttons are clicked (excessive re-rendering)

## Recent Changes
- Created Scene component with fixed isometric camera view
- Implemented Calculator component with 3D layout and materials
- Created CalculatorButton component with interactive states
- Set up calculator logic with useCalculator hook
- Updated main page to display the calculator
- Added "use client" directives to components using client-side features
- Optimized WebGL context settings to prevent context loss
- Fixed nested Canvas components issue by restructuring component hierarchy
- Added proper component keys for stable rendering

## Current Status
- Basic 3D calculator structure is implemented
- Core calculator functionality is working
- Interactive 3D buttons with visual feedback
- Isometric camera view is fixed and working
- Fixed rendering errors related to Next.js client/server components
- Stabilized WebGL context to prevent context loss on page updates
- Visual issues with background color and text visibility need to be addressed
- Camera controls need to be enabled for better user interaction
- Re-rendering optimization needed to prevent display flashing

## Active Decisions
1. **Camera Setup**: Using fixed isometric view with disabled controls for consistent perspective
   - Need to revise to allow user camera control with reasonable limits
2. **Button Layout**: Standard calculator layout with 3D buttons
3. **Visual Design**: Modern calculator style with:
   - Light gray body
   - Black display
   - Orange operator buttons
   - Gray function buttons
   - White number buttons
4. **Interaction Model**: 3D buttons with hover and press animations
5. **Next.js Integration**: All Three.js components marked as client components with "use client" directive
6. **WebGL Context**: Optimized settings with preserveDrawingBuffer and high-performance preference
   - Need to revise alpha setting to fix black background issue
7. **Rendering Optimization**: 
   - Need to implement better component memoization
   - Improve state management to reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Consider separating display from interactive elements

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix black background issue by adjusting WebGL context settings
2. Enable camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate) with appropriate limits
3. Fix display text visibility issue for calculator input
4. Optimize rendering to prevent display number flashing
5. Add shadows and improve lighting
6. Implement button press animations

### Secondary Tasks
1. Add sound effects for interactions
2. Add keyboard support
3. Implement responsive adjustments
4. Add accessibility features
5. Optimize performance

## Open Questions
- Should we add more visual feedback for operations?
- Do we need to implement extended calculator functions?
- Should we add a background or environment to the scene? 
- What are the appropriate limits for camera controls to maintain good UX?
- Should we use HTML overlay for the display instead of 3D text for better stability?
