# Product Context

## Purpose
This 3D calculator application serves as a creative demonstration of Three.js capabilities in a practical web application. It transforms an everyday utility (calculator) into an engaging 3D experience while maintaining full functionality.

## Problems Solved
1. **Engagement**: Standard calculators are functional but visually unengaging. The 3D isometric approach creates a visually interesting experience that draws users in.
2. **Learning**: The project showcases how to implement practical UI interactions in a 3D environment using Three.js and React.
3. **Demonstration**: Serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating technical skill in 3D web development.

## Target Users
- Web developers interested in Three.js examples
- Portfolio viewers and potential employers/clients
- Users who appreciate creative approaches to everyday tools

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Despite the 3D perspective, the calculator should remain easy to use
- **Responsive**: Work well across device sizes, adjusting the 3D scene appropriately 
- **Visually Polished**: Professional aesthetic with attention to lighting, materials, and animations
- **Performance**: Maintain smooth performance even on mid-range devices
- **Accessible**: Core functionality should be accessible even to users who might have difficulty with 3D interfaces
