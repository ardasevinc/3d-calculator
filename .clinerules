# 3D Calculator Project Rules

## File Structure
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Prefer named exports unless it's a page component (Next.js routes)

## Component Organization
- 3D components in `src/components/three`
- UI components in `src/components/ui`
- Shared components in `src/components/shared`

## Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for UI components
- Use Three.js materials for 3D styling
- Keep design consistent with a cohesive color palette

## Code Patterns
- Separate calculator logic from rendering
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper TypeScript typing

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Use isometric camera setup for all 3D scenes
- Keep 3D assets simple and performant
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper feedback
- Follow accessibility best practices even for 3D interfaces 
- use bun instead of npm.
